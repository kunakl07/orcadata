# orcasound/orcadata/AISprocessing

Python3 routines to:
 
    decode AIS strings

    transfer AIS data to S3 bucket

    read S3 bucket from EC2 Ubuntu instance

    find metadata for ship ids (mmsi numbers)

        check RDS mysql database (shipspecs) for ship metadata

        go out on WWW and get ship metadata and then update mysql database

    construct summary html file and put in S3 bucket

See AWS_FlowDiagram.jpg for flow chart

(1)  Read AIS data from the serial port and determine if ships are ‘in range’ and if so, upload report to S3.

Computer:  Ubuntu laptop at hydrophone node connected to AIS vhf radio receiver

Program:  AIS_node_to_EC2.py

Parameters:  Node latitude and longitude, Center of shipping lanes lat and long,  Range (m) for the ship to be “in range”, (default 10000),  Port for serial port ('/dev/ttyUSB0'), S3 bucket/filename where reports are put (/home/val/pythonFiles/upload/OS_rt.txt)

(2)  From EC2, download file from S3 bucket (and print first items in file's lines)

Program:  aws_ec2_access_s3.py

Parameters: local and EC2 file names with paths

(3)  With mmsi number go out on the web and find metadata for this ship (ship name, ship type,.....)

Program: parsePage.py

Parameters: mmsi number

(4)  Pull everything together in a single program

Program: processAIS.py
